# Public-API-Request
A user generation project utilizing https://randomuser.me API Keys


## Background
Created for Project 5 of the Treehouse Fullstack Tech Degree.

What I loved most about this project was the lack of "hand-holding". There was no guide for me to follow,
and I had to create most of the functionality on my own.

### Future Improvements

1. Add a search bar that would allow you to search through users
2. Create a next/previous system when you click on a user for easier an easier user interface
